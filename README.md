# java-game-of-life
A game of life created for automata

This program implements the game of life with various rule sets including viruses.



This is a project I maide for automata implementing John Conway's game of life.  No liscencing information is included,
because I have not done my due dilegence checking what if any rights are mine, what are the schools, and what 
still belongs to Johns Conway.  All rights should be assumed reserved until contacting the right holder.
